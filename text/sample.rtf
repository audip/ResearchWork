\f0\fs24 \cf0  p Over a year ago we added an a href http www remobjects com tv video page a on our site At the time OGV wasn t very good and there was no good WebM encoders available so we decided to use HTML5 and h 264 for webkit browsers Chrome Safari etc and then fallback to Flash for other browsers using the same h 264 source file p p This has been working great for a while Recently month or two maybe so over multiple Chrome versions currently Version 24 0 1312 52 m we discovered Chrome really lagging on the playback We thought it was a server issue so we upgraded the server and it is still behaving the same I remembered reading that Google wanted to drop h 264 and move everyone to WebM and thought this performance was part of that We converted some videos to WebM and tested them with Chrome and they lag just as bad Same video WebM streams beautifully in FireFox and the MP4 streams great in FireFox via the Flash plug in p p I went to YouTube and turned on the HTML5 video support and found the videos to lag in Chrome too when running at HD while they play fine in Flash mode Even when HTML5 is enabled some videos still play via Flash p p Tested on both Windows 8 and Mountain Lion p p I ve talked to co workers and they are seeing the same issues So it isn t just me So my question is p ol li Is this an issue with our video encoding li li Is it a bug with Chrome li li Or is it just localized to us li li Is there a way to deal with this besides switching back to Flash li ol }
