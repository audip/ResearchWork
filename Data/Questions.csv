And also, why does angular reloads the data? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ruby seems to chop off the milliseconds:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.3-rc1 :078 &gt; '2012-12-31T01:01:01.232323+3'.to_datetime
 =&gt; Mon, 31 Dec 2012 01:01:01 +0300 
</code></pre>

<p>Postgrs supports microsecond resolution.  How can I get my timestamp to be saved accordingly? I need at least millisecond resolution.</p>

<p>(PS Yes I could hack in a milliseconds integer column in postgres; that kind of defeats the whole purpose of ActiveRecord.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
The very helpful responses showed that Ruby's <code>DateTime</code> is <em>not</em> chopping off milliseconds; using <code>#to_f</code> shows it.  But, doing:</p>

<pre><code>m.happened_at = '2012-01-01T00:00:00.32323'.to_datetime
m.save!
m.reload
m.happened_at.to_f
</code></pre>

<p>Does drop the milliseconds.</p>

<p>Now, the interesting thing is that <code>created_at</code> does show milliseconds, both in Rails and Postgres.  But other timestamps fields (like <code>happened_at</code> above) don't.  (Perhaps Rails uses a <code>NOW()</code> function for <code>created_at</code> as opposed to passing in a DateTime).</p>

<p>Which leads to my ultimate question:<br>
<strong>How can I get ActiveRecord to preserve millisecond resolution on timestamp fields?</strong></p>

<p>I use my class to login to an API and then request data. In a Windows 8 ""Metro"" application, it works exactly as expected. On a Windows Phone 8 application, the login appears to succeed, but in the subsequent request for data, no cookies are sent and the server responds as if the client is not logged in.</p>

<p>Here is the class, this exact same code is used in the Windows 8 app and the Windows Phone app:</p>

<pre><code>class Class1
    {
        CookieContainer cookieJar = new CookieContainer();
        CookieCollection responseCookies = new CookieCollection();

        public async Task&lt;string&gt; httpRequest(HttpWebRequest request)
        {
            string received;

            using (var response = (HttpWebResponse)(await Task&lt;WebResponse&gt;.Factory.FromAsync(request.BeginGetResponse, request.EndGetResponse, null)))
            {
                using (var responseStream = response.GetResponseStream())
                {
                    using (var sr = new StreamReader(responseStream))
                    {
                        cookieJar = request.CookieContainer;
                        responseCookies = response.Cookies;
                        received = await sr.ReadToEndAsync();
                    }
                }
            }

            return received;
        }

        public async Task&lt;string&gt; get(string path)
        {
            var request = WebRequest.Create(new Uri(path)) as HttpWebRequest;
            request.CookieContainer = cookieJar;

            return await httpRequest(request);
        }

        public async Task&lt;string&gt; post(string path, string postdata)
        {
            var request = WebRequest.Create(new Uri(path)) as HttpWebRequest;
            request.Method = ""POST"";
            request.CookieContainer = cookieJar;

            byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postdata);
            using (var requestStream = await Task&lt;Stream&gt;.Factory.FromAsync(request.BeginGetRequestStream, request.EndGetRequestStream, null))
            {
                await requestStream.WriteAsync(data, 0, data.Length);
            }

            return await httpRequest(request);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And the code to initiate the requests:</p>

<pre><code>    var n = new Class1();
    await n.post(""https://mydomain.com/api/login/"", ""username=myusername&amp;password=mypassword"");
    await n.get(""https://mydomain.com/reader/feeds/"");
</code></pre>

<p>The curious thing is that if I prefix the domain name with ""www."" it works in both the Windows Phone 8 app and the Windows 8 Metro app.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with how the domain is handled. The cookie's domain is "".mydomain.com"", and without the prefix it must think the cookie's do not belong to that domain. After some searching I found <a href=""http://blog.codeblack.nl/post/HttpWebRequest-HttpWebResponse-and-cookies.aspx"">a report of someone noticing a similar problem</a>.</p>

<p>What I do not understand is why this is treated differently in the Windows 8 app than the Windows Phone app, so that line-for-line identical code works on one platform but fails on another.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have done some more digging into this.</p>

<p>The server code I used for this is in PHP:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

if ($_REQUEST[""what""] == ""set"")
{
    setcookie(""TestCookie"",$_REQUEST[""username""] . "" "" . $_REQUEST[""password""], time()+3600*24, ""/"", ""subd.mydomain.com"");
}

if ($_GET[""what""] == ""get"")
{
    var_dump($_COOKIE);
</code></pre>

<p>Client code in C#:</p>

<pre><code>    var n = new ClassLibrary1.Class1();
            await n.get(""http://subd.mydomain.com/?what=set&amp;username=foo&amp;password=bar"");
            await n.get(""http://subd.mydomain.com/?what=get"");
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of a cookie response from the server</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: ARRAffinity=295612ca; Path=/;Domain=subd.mydomain.com
Set-Cookie: TestCookie=foo+bar; expires=Fri, 04-Jan-2013 17:19:25 GMT; path=/; domain=subd.mydomain.com
</code></pre>

<p>In the Windows 8 Store/Metro app, this is the result:</p>

<pre><code>array(2) {
  [""ARRAffinity""]=&gt;
  string(8) ""295612ca""
  [""TestCookie""]=&gt;
  string(7) ""foo bar""
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the Windows Phone app, this is the result:</p>

<pre><code>array(0){
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Windows Phone does not see any cookies when they are set this way.</p>

<p>I change how <code>TestCookie</code> is set, the result from the server now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: ARRAffinity=295612ca;Path=/;Domain=subd.mydomain.com
Set-Cookie: TestCookie=foo+bar; expires=Fri, 04-Jan-2013 17:29:59 GMT; path=/
</code></pre>

<p><code>TestCookie</code> now does not explicitly set a domain, ARRAffinity is unchanged.</p>

<p>The Windows 8 Store/Metro app now returns this:</p>

<pre><code>array(2) {
  [""TestCookie""]=&gt;
  string(7) ""foo bar""
  [""ARRAffinity""]=&gt;
  string(8) ""295612ca""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Windows Phone 8 app, returns this:</p>

<pre><code>array(1) {
  [""TestCookie""]=&gt;
  string(7) ""foo bar""
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ARRAffinity</code> cookie is not sent because it explicitly declares a domain.</p>

<p>If I assign some breakpoints and check the <code>CookieContainer</code> of the request, I have two entries in the <code>m_domainTable</code></p>

<pre><code>+       [0] {[.subd.mydomain.com, System.Net.PathList]} System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair&lt;string,System.Net.PathList&gt;
+       [1] {[subd.mydomain.com, System.Net.PathList]}  System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair&lt;string,System.Net.PathList&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The cookie that isn't sent, is in the <code>.subd.mydomain.com</code> container. This is the same on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.</p>

<p>However, if the cookie declares itself like this:</p>

<pre><code>Set-Cookie: TestCookie=foo+bar; expires=Fri, 04-Jan-2013 17:19:25 GMT; path=/; domain=.mydomain.com
</code></pre>

<p>It is correctly sent on Windows Phone 8.</p>

<p>In my original case, the server declares the cookie the same way regardless of if it is accessed via mydomain.com or www.mydomain.com; as "".mydomain.com"", but Windows Phone 8 doesn't seem to think a cookie for "".mydomain.com"" should be sent to ""mydomain.com"". This is problematic, as even if the server puts ""subd.mydomain.com"" as the domain, it is treated as having a preceding dot, and then doesn't work through no fault of its own. It seems it has to not send domain info with the cookie to have it treated correctly.</p>

<p>The sample itself works very well on my Galaxy S3 when in portrait mode, but I have a few issues with it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if the screen is small (for example on qvga screens), the shown images get cropped.</p></li>
<li><p>if I have an input bitmap that is too small than how I wish to show it, the output image has its edges smeared. Even on the Galaxy S3, when you run the sample code and it's on landscape, it looks awful:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nr2Hw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p>I'm still not sure about it (since I use a workaround of scaling the image for using the sample code), but it think that even this solution is a bit slow when being used in a listView. Maybe there is a renderscript solution for this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It doesn't matter if I use setImageDrawable or setBackgroundDrawable. It must be something in the drawable itself.</p>

<p>I've tried to play with the variables and the bitmapShader, but nothing worked. Sadly <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Shader.TileMode.html""><strong>TileMode</strong></a> doesn't have a value for just stretching the image, only tiling it in some way.</p>

<p>As a workaround I can create a new scaled bitmap, but it's just a workaround. Surely there is a better way which will also not use more memory than it should.</p>

<p>How do I fix those issues and use this great code?</p>

<p>I am currently working on a project that requires me to talk to a Unidata database. PHP has no native driver to access this type of database, however, after some Googling, I found the following:</p>

<p><a href=""https://u2devzone.rocketsoftware.com/accelerate/articles/u2-pdo-driver/u2-pdo-driver"">https://u2devzone.rocketsoftware.com/accelerate/articles/u2-pdo-driver/u2-pdo-driver</a>.</p>

<p>I have the U2 Intercall header and library and I think I am including them correctly. However, the extension compiles but does not pass the tests as it errors out with</p>

<pre><code>pdo_u2.so: undefined symbol: ic_universe_session in Unknown on line 0
</code></pre>

<p>which suggests to me that it is not being linked against the library. When I edit the makefile and specify by hand that the library should be included, it errors out with </p>

<pre><code>relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata.str1.1' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
/home/kaigoh/Downloads/intcall/lib/libuvic.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [pdo_u2.la] Error 1
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried forcing the -fPIC switch in the makefile but I get the same error.</p>

<p>I simply do not know enough about compiling custom PHP extensions to assist myself, and I am hoping there is a guru here who can point me in the right direction!</p>

<p>UPDATE: This compiles perfectly using a 32-bit install of Linux, so no idea why it is failing with a 64-bit install...</p>

<p>When reading about <a href=""http://files.meetup.com/2922732/Computation%20Expressions%20%28April%29.pdf"">extended computation expressions</a>, I come across very cool IL DSL by @kvb:</p>

<pre><code>let il = ILBuilder()

// will return 42 when called
// val fortyTwoFn : (unit -&gt; int)
let fortyTwoFn = 
    il {
        ldc_i4 6
        ldc_i4_0
        ldc_i4 7
        add
        mul
        ret
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder how the operations compose without using <code>for..in..do</code> construct. My gut feeling is that it starts with <code>x.Zero</code> member, but I haven't found any reference to verify that.</p>

<p>If the example above is too technical, here is a similar DSL where components of a slide are listed without <code>for..in..do</code>:</p>

<pre><code>page {
      title ""Happy New Year F# community""
      item ""May F# continue to shine as it did in 2012""
      code @""…""
      button (…)
} |&gt; SlideShow.show
</code></pre>

<p>I have a few closely related questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>How does one define or use extended computation expressions without <code>For</code> member (i.e. provide a small complete example)?</em> I don't worry much if they aren't monads any longer, I'm interested in them in developing DSLs.</li>
<li><em>Can we use extended computation expressions with <code>let!</code> and <code>return!</code>? If yes, is there any reason of not doing so?</em> I ask these questions because I haven't encountered any example using <code>let!</code> and <code>return!</code>.</li>

<p>However, recently I've become unsure as to whether doing that is safe. After all, there is no reference to the <code>Main</code> object after it's created (well, there is the <code>this</code> reference, but does that count?), so it looks like there's a danger that the garbage collector might delete the object while it's in the middle of executing something. So perhaps the <code>main</code> method should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main m = new Main();
        m.run();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'm pretty sure that the first version works and I've never had any problems with it, but I'd like to know if it's safe to do in all cases (not only in a specific JVM, but preferably according to what the language specification says about such cases).</p>

<ol>
<li>Web application downloads and installs in appcache (uses manifest)</li>
<li>Web app requests from server PNG data files (how? - see alternatives below)</li>
<li>Occasionally web app resyncs with server, and does small partial updates/deletes/additions to PNG database</li>
<li>FYI: Server is a JSON REST server, that can place files in wwwroot for pickup</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is my current analysis of client-based ""databases"" that handle binary blob storage</p>

<h1>SEE UPDATE at Bottom</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>AppCache</strong> (via manifest add all the PNG and then update on demand)
<ul>
<li>CON: any change of a PNG database item will mean complete download of all items in manifest (Really bad news!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>WebStorage</strong>
<ul>
<li>CON: Designed for JSON storage</li>
<li>CON: can only store blobs via base64 encoding (probably fatal flaw due to cost of de-encoding)</li>
<li>CON: Hard limit of 5MB for webStorage <a href=""http://htmlui.com/blog/2011-08-23-5-obscure-facts-about-html5-localstorage.html"">http://htmlui.com/blog/2011-08-23-5-obscure-facts-about-html5-localstorage.html</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>PhoneGap &amp; SQLLite</strong>
<ul>
<li>CON: Sponsor will reject it as a native app requiring certification</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ZIP file</strong>
<ul>
<li>Server creates a zip file, places it in wwwroot, and notifies client</li>
<li>user has to manually unzip (At least that is how I see it) and save to client file system</li>
<li>Web app uses FileSystem API to reference files</li>
<li>CON: ZIP might be too large (zip64?), long time to create</li>
<li>CON: Not sure if FileSystem API can always read out of the sandbox (I think so)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>USB or SD card</strong> (back to the stone age....)
<ul>
<li>The user will be local to the server before going offline</li>
<li>So we could have him insert a SD card, let the server fill it with PNG files</li>
<li>Then the user will plug it into the laptop, tablet</li>
<li>Web app will use FileSystem API to read the files </li>
<li>CON: Not sure if FileSystem API can always read out of the sandbox (I think so)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>WebSQL</strong>
<ul>
<li>CON: w3c has abandoned it (pretty bad)</li>
<li>I might consider a Javascript wrapper that uses IndexedDB and WebSQL as a fall-back</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>FileSystem API</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chrome supports read/write of blobs </li>
<li>CON: not clear about IE and FireFox (IE10, has non-standard msSave)</li>
<li>caniuse.com reports IOS and Android support (but again, is this just r/w of JSON, or does it include the full blob API for writing?</li>
<li>CON: FireFox folks dislike FileSystem API &amp; not clear if they are supporting saving blobs: <a href=""https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/why-no-filesystem-api-in-firefox/"">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/why-no-filesystem-api-in-firefox/</a></li>
<li>PRO: <em>Much</em> faster than IndexedDB for blobs according to jsperf <a href=""http://jsperf.com/indexeddb-vs-localstorage/15"">http://jsperf.com/indexeddb-vs-localstorage/15</a> (page 2)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>IndexedDB</strong>
<ul>
<li>Good support in IE10, FireFox (save, read blobs)</li>
<li>Good speed and easier management than a file system (deletes, updates) </li>
<li>PRO: see speed tests: <a href=""http://jsperf.com/indexeddb-vs-localstorage/15"">http://jsperf.com/indexeddb-vs-localstorage/15</a></li>

<li>CON: I confirmed that Chrome does not yet support blob writing (current bug, but not clear when it will be fixed)</li>
<li>UPDATE: Chrome developers confirm they are working on this for both desktop and android! no timeline yet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>LawnChair</strong> JavaScript wrapper <a href=""http://brian.io/lawnchair/"">http://brian.io/lawnchair/</a>
<ul>
<li>PRO: very clean wrapper for IndexedDB, WebSQL or whatever database you have (think polyfill)</li>
<li>CON: cannot store binary blobs, only data:uri (base64 encoding) (probably fatal flaw due to cost of de-encoding)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>IndexedDB JQUERY</strong> polyFill <a href=""https://github.com/axemclion/jquery-indexeddb"">https://github.com/axemclion/jquery-indexeddb</a>
<ul>
<li>Parashuram has writtent a nice JQUERY wrapper for the raw IndexedDB interface</li>
<li>PRO: greatly simplifies using IndexedDB, I was hoping to add a shim/polyfill for Chrome FileSystemAPI</li>
<li>CON: It should handle blobs, but I was unable to get it to work</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>idb.filesystem.js</strong> <a href=""http://ericbidelman.tumblr.com/post/21649963613/idb-filesystem-js-bringing-the-html5-filesystem-api"">http://ericbidelman.tumblr.com/post/21649963613/idb-filesystem-js-bringing-the-html5-filesystem-api</a>
<ul>
<li>Eric Bidelman @ Google has written a well tested PolyFill the FileSystem API that uses Indexed DB as a fall back</li>
<li>PRO: FileSystem API is well suited for storing blobs</li>
<li>PRO: works great on FireFox and Chrome
<ul>
<li>PRO: great for synchronizing with cloud based CouchDB</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CON: no clear why, but it is not working on IE10</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>PouchDB</strong> JavaScript Library <a href=""http://pouchdb.com/"">http://pouchdb.com/</a>
<ul>
<li>great for syncing a CouchDB with a local DB (uses either WebSQL or IndexedDB (not my problem though)</li>
<li>CON: NO CONS, PouchDB now supports binary blobs for all recent browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Chrome on mobile, etc.) as well as many older browsers. That was not the case when I first did this post.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: to see a data:uri encoding of PNG I created an example at: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ivefak/1/edit"">http://jsbin.com/ivefak/1/edit</a></p>

<p><strong>Desired/Usefull/Uneeded Features</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No native (EXE, PhoneGap, ObjectiveC, etc) app on client (pure web application)</li>
<li>Only needs to run on latest Chrome, FireFox, IE10 for laptops</li>
<li>Strongly want same solution for Android Tablet (IOS would be nice too) but only need one browser to work (FF, Chrome, etc.)</li>
<li>Fast initial DB population</li>
<li>REQUIREMENT: Very fast retrieval of images by web application from storage (DB, file)</li>
<li>Not meant for consumers. We can restrict browsers, and ask user to do special setup &amp; tasks, but let's minimize that</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IndexedDB Implementations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There is an excellent article on how IE,FF,and Chrome internally implement this at: <a href=""http://www.aaron-powell.com/web/indexeddb-storage"">http://www.aaron-powell.com/web/indexeddb-storage</a></li>
<li>In short:
<ul>
<li>IE uses the same database format as Exchange and Active Directory for IndexedDB</li>
<li>Firefox is using SQLite so are kind of implementing a NoSQL database in to SQL database</li>
<li>Chrome (and WebKit) are using a Key/ Value store which has heritage in BigTable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Current Results</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I chose to use an IndexedDB approach (and polyfill with FileSystemAPI for Chrome until they ship blob support)</li>
<li>For fetching the tiles, I had a dilemna since the JQUERY folks are kvetching about adding this to AJAX</li>
<li>I went with XHR2-Lib by Phil Parsons, which is very much like JQUERY .ajax() <a href=""https://github.com/p-m-p/xhr2-lib"">https://github.com/p-m-p/xhr2-lib</a></li>
<li>Performance for 100MB downloads (IE10 4s, Chrome 6s, FireFox 7s). </li>
<li>I could not get any of the IndexedDB wrappers to work for blobs (lawnchair, PouchDB, jquery-indexeddb, etc.)</li>
<li>I rolled my own wrapper, and performance is (IE10 2s, Chrome 3s, FireFox 10s)</li>
<li>With FF, I assume we are seeing the performance issue of using a relational DB (sqllite) for a non-sql storage</li>
<li>NOTE, Chrome has outstanding debug tools (developer tab, resources) for inspecting the state of the IndexedDB.</li>
</ul>

Part of the release process is to use the Maven GPG Plugin to sign artifacts which requires among other things, the GPG signing key passphrase to succeed.  Because these builds need to be runnable in a non interactive environment, (CI-Server) these params are passed in as arguments to maven in the form of </p>

<pre><code>-Dgpg.passphrase=XXX
</code></pre>

<p>For snapshot builds everything works fine; the Maven GPG Plugin sees the passed in passphrase, artifacts are built, signed and deployed as expected, however, when I try to use the release plugin I get prompted for the gpg signing key password.  I've read through several discussions on similar issues that stem from the release plugin forking another invocation of maven which does not receive the passed in params.  The most popular fix seems to be to use the ""arguments"" parameter like this:</p>

<pre><code>-Darguments=""-Dgpg.passphrase=XXX""
</code></pre>

<p>Supposedly this gets passed to the forked instance but unfortunately for me it's not getting rid of the prompt.</p>

<p>Since signing artifacts is not an uncommon prerequisite for deploying release artifacts to public maven repos and presumably most entities producing those artifacts are using some form of CI I can't imagine I'm the only person who has encountered this problem.

<p>As it stands, this throws <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: org.bouncycastle.jce.exception.ExtCertPathValidatorException: Could not validate certificate signature.</code> when <code>getOutputStream()</code> is called.</p>

<p>This same site and certificate are valid in the stock HTC web browser and desktop browsers. When I use the same code to access <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">Google</a> it works (but then complains about a 404 error). Various posts on StackOverflow imply that it should ""just work"" and others say to set up your own key store (or disable all HTTPS validation!) I assume the difference in behaviour is down to different root key stores in use (Can anyone clarify this?).</p>

<p>I've now tried creating a key store using bouncy castle but I can't get this to load on my device.</p>

<p>After exporting the certificate from Firefox, I create a key store using:</p>

<pre><code>keytool.exe -import -alias onlinescoutmanager -file www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk.crt -storetype BKS -keystore res\raw\keystore
</code></pre>

<p>This is then loaded and used in the application using:</p>

<pre><code>InputStream stream = context.getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.keystore);
// BKS seems to be the default but we want to be explicit
KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""BKS"");
ks.load(stream, ""www.onlinescoutmanager.co.uk"".toCharArray());
stream.close();

TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
tmf.init(ks);
X509TrustManager defaultTrustManager = (X509TrustManager) tmf.getTrustManagers()[0];
SSLContext context2 = SSLContext.getInstance(""TLS"");
context2.init(null, new TrustManager[] { defaultTrustManager }, null);
sslSocketFactory = context2.getSocketFactory();
</code></pre>

<p>This is failing with <code>java.io.IOException: Wrong version of key store.</code> when <code>keystore.Load()</code> is called.</p>

<p>I have <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/5187509/588306"">ensured I'm passing <code>-storetype BKS</code></a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/12528853/588306"">used a &lt;=7 character keystore password</a>, added the CA certs to the key store, and using both Bouncy Castle version 1.45 and 1.47 to create the key store with no change in the reported error message.</p>

<p>My environment is Eclipse Juno 4.2.1 with JRE 1.7u9b5 running on Windows 8. The device I'm testing on is an HTC sensation running stock Android 2.3. The application has a minimum SDK version of 7 and a target of 15.</p>

<p>My bottleneck is <code>UIImagePNGRepresentation</code>. It takes about 0.10-0.15 seconds to generate every 256 x 256 image.</p>

<p>I've tried generating multiple tiles on different background queue's, but this only cuts it down to about 9-10 seconds.</p>

<p>I've also tried using the ImageIO framework with code like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)writeCGImage:(CGImageRef)image toURL:(NSURL*)url andOptions:(CFDictionaryRef) options
{
    CGImageDestinationRef myImageDest = CGImageDestinationCreateWithURL((__bridge CFURLRef)url, (__bridge CFStringRef)@""public.png"", 1, nil);

<p>Is there any way to encode a PNG image from <code>CGImage</code> faster? Perhaps a library that makes use of <code>NEON</code> ARM extension (iPhone 3GS+) like <a href=""http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/"">libjpeg-turbo</a> does?</p>

<p>Is there perhaps a better format than PNG for saving tiles that doesn't take up a lot of space?</p>

<p>The only viable option I've been able to come up with is to increase the tile size to 512 x 512. This cuts the encoding time by half. Not sure what that will do to my scroll view though. The app is for iPad 2+, and only supports iOS 6 (using iPhone 4S as a baseline).</p>

<p>I want to link the static library (<code>libmylib.a</code>) to the program object (<code>main.o</code>), although the latter does not use any symbol of the former directly.</p>

<p>The following commands do not seem to the job with <code>g++ 4.7</code>. They will run without any errors or warnings, but apparently <code>libmylib.a</code> will not be linked:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -o program main.o -Wl,--no-as-needed /path/to/libmylib.a
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>g++ -o program main.o -L/path/to/ -Wl,--no-as-needed -lmylib
</code></pre>

<p>Do you have any better ideas?</p>
