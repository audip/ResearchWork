It's not a big deal here but over time you will find that having, what is essentially business logic like this (ordering) on a view template becomes a mess.  Move it to the controller, or ideally the model and make a scope available there that you can use.  One example - if you end up with three screens or templates that use the dropdown, having the order in the views means 3 X duplication.  Having it in the model means it is defined in one place and that's the only place to change it which is good.","2014-08-28 17:19:22","","631619"

If we use only the departureDate and the flighNumber then we will have a duplicate flight (the flight scheduled for day n+1 and the one originally scheduled for day n but rescheduled to day n+1 due to the delay). In order to keep the same flightNumber so we avoid client confusion, we add just a suffix (i.e 'D' for example).","2015-01-14 10:23:06","","3094941"
