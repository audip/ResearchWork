<p>That said, I suspect that ActiveRecord is mistakenly hiding that information when persisting the data; remember that it is database-agnostic, so it takes approaches that are guaranteed to work across all of its database targets. While Postgres supposed microsecond information in timestamps, MySQL does not, so I suspect AR selects for the lowest common denominator. I couldn't be sure without getting into the guts of AR. You may need a Postgres-specific monkeypatch to enable this behavior.</p>

"14107418","2","","14107354","2013-01-01 02:14:17","7","","<p>ActiveRecord should preserve the full precision from the database, you're just not looking at it properly. Use <code>strftime</code> and the <code>%N</code> format to see the fractional seconds. For example, <code>psql</code> says this:</p>

<pre><code>=&gt; select created_at from models where id = 1;
         created_at         
----------------------------
 2012-02-07 07:36:20.949641
(1 row)
</code></pre>

<p>and ActiveRecord says this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Model.find(1).created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N')
 =&gt; ""2012-02-07 07:36:20.949641000"" 
</code></pre>

<p>So everything is there, you just need to know how to see it.</p>

<p>Also note that ActiveRecord will probably give you <code>ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone</code> objects rather than <code>DateTime</code> objects but <code>DateTime</code> preserves everything too:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; '2012-12-31T01:01:01.232323+3'.to_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N')
 =&gt; ""2012-12-31 01:01:01.232323000"" 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Have a look at <code>connection_adapters/column.rb</code> in the ActiveRecord source and check what the <code>string_to_time</code> method does. Your string would go down  the <code>fallback_string_to_time</code> path and that preserves fractional seconds as near as I can tell. Something strange could be going on elsewhere, I wouldn't be surprised given the strange things I've seen in the Rails source, especially the database side of things. I'd try converting the strings to objects by hand so that ActiveRecord will keeps its hands off them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10.0.0.0/8 was the old ARPANET, which they picked up on 01-Jan-1983. When they shut down the ARPANET in 1990, the 10.0.0.0/8 block was freed. There was much argument about if there should ever be private IP spaces, given that a goal of IPv4 was universal to all hosts on the net.</p>
  
  <p>In then end, practicality won out, and RFC 1597 reserved the now well known private address spaces. When ARPANET went away, the 10.0.0.0/8 allocation was marked as reserved and since it was known that the ARPANET was truly gone (the hosts being moved to MILNET, NSFNET or the Internet) it was decided that this was the best Class A block to allocate.</p>
  
  <p>Note Class A. This was before CIDR. So, the Class A, B and C private address netblocks needed to come out of the correct IP ranges.</p>
  
  <p>I know that 172.16.0.0/12 was picked because it offered the most continuous block of Class B (/16) addresses in the IP space that was in a reserved block. 192.0.0.0/24 was always reserved for the same reason that 0.0.0.0/8 and 128.0.0.0/16 were reserved (first blocks of the old Class C, A and B network blocks) so assigning 192.168.0.0/24 out as private fit well -- 192.0.2.0/24 was already TEST-NET, where you could use them in public documentation without fear of someone trying it (see example.com for another example.)""</p>

"17743713","2","","14109187","2013-07-19 10:19:21","0","","<p>There underlying problem is that the BitmapShader's <code>TileMode</code> doesn't have a scaling option. You'll note in the source that it's been set to <code>Shader.TileMode.CLAMP</code>, and the docs describe that as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>replicate the edge color if the shader draws outside of its original bounds </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To work around this, there are three solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Constrain the size of the view in which the drawable is used to the size of the bitmap.</li>
<li><p>Constrain the drawing region; for instance, change:</p>

<pre><code>int width = bounds.width() - mMargin;
int height = bounds.height() - mMargin;
mRect.set(mMargin, mMargin, width, height);
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>int width = Math.min(mBitmap.getWidth(), bounds.width()) - mMargin;
int height = Math.min(mBitmap.getHeight(), bounds.height()) - mMargin;
mRect.set(mMargin, mMargin, width, height);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Scale the bitmap to the size of the drawable. I've moved creating the shader into onBoundsChange() and have opted to create a new bitmap from here:</p>

<pre><code>bitmap = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(mBitmap, width, height, true);
mBitmapShader = new BitmapShader(bitmap,
        Shader.TileMode.CLAMP, Shader.TileMode.CLAMP);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this a potentially slow operation and will be running on the main thread. You might want to carefully consider how you want to implement it before you go for this last solution.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection XSRF is a technique by
  which an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular
  provides following mechanism to counter XSRF. When performing XHR
  requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie called
  XSRF-TOKEN and sets it as the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN. Since only
  JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server
  can be assured that the XHR came from JavaScript running on your
  domain.</p>
  
  <p>To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a
  JavaScript readable session cookie called XSRF-TOKEN on first HTTP GET
  request. On subsequent non-GET requests the server can verify that the
  cookie matches X-XSRF-TOKEN HTTP header, and therefore be sure that
  only JavaScript running on your domain could have read the token. The
  token must be unique for each user and must be verifiable by the
  server (to prevent the JavaScript making up its own tokens). We
  recommend that the token is a digest of your site's authentication
  cookie with salt for added security.</p>

But here are some remarks from some my experiments that might help....</p>

<p>Firstly, I think it is not possible to freely combine standard computation expression features (<code>return!</code> etc.) with custom operations. Some combinations are apparently allowed, but not all. For example, if I define custom operation <code>left</code> and <code>return!</code> then I can only use the custom operation <em>before</em> <code>return!</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Does not compile              // Compiles and works
moves { return! lr               moves { left 
        left }                           return! lr }
</code></pre>

<p>As for the computations that use only custom operations, most common cusotom operations (<code>orderBy</code>, <code>reverse</code> and this kind) have a type <code>M&lt;'T&gt; -&gt; M&lt;'T&gt;</code> where <code>M&lt;'T&gt;</code> is some (possibly generic) type that represent the thing we're building (e.g. a list).</p>

<p>For example, if we want to build a value that represents a sequence of left/right moves, we can use the following <code>Commands</code> type:</p>

<pre><code>type Command = Left | Right 
type Commands = Commands of Command list
</code></pre>

<p>Custom operations like <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> can then transform <code>Commands</code> into <code>Commands</code> and append the new step to the end of the list. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>type MovesBuilder() =
  [&lt;CustomOperation(""left"")&gt;]
  member x.Left(Commands c) = Commands(c @ [Left])
  [&lt;CustomOperation(""right"")&gt;]
  member x.Right(Commands c) = Commands(c @ [Right])
</code></pre>

<p>Note this is different from <code>yield</code> which returns just a single operation - or command - and so <code>yield</code> needs <code>Combine</code> to combine multiple individual steps if you use custom operations, then you never need to combine anything because the custom operations gradually build the <code>Commands</code> value as a whole. It only needs some initial <em>empty</em> <code>Commands</code> value that is used at the beginning...</p>

<p>Now, I would expect to see <code>Zero</code> there, but it actually calls <code>Yield</code> with unit as an argument, so you need:</p>

<pre><code>member x.Yield( () ) = 
  Commands[]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why this is the case, but <code>Zero</code> is quite often defined as <code>Yield ()</code>, so perhaps the goal is to use the default definition (but as I said, I'd also expect to use <code>Zero</code> here...)</p>

<p>I think combining custom operations with computation expressions makes sense. While I have strong opinions on how standard <em>computation expressions</em> should be used, I do not really have any good intuition about computations with custom operations - I think the community still needs to figure this out :-). But for example, you can extend the above computation like this:</p>

<pre><code>member x.Bind(Commands c1, f) = 
  let (Commands c2) = f () in Commands(c1 @ c2)
member x.For(c, f) = x.Bind(c, f)
member x.Return(a) = x.Yield(a)
</code></pre>

<p>(At some point, the translation will start requiring <code>For</code> and <code>Return</code>, but here they can be defined just like <code>Bind</code> and <code>Yield</code> - and I do not fully understand when is which alternative used).</p>

<p>Then you can write something like:</p>

<pre><code>let moves = MovesBuilder()

let lr = 
  moves { left
          right }    
let res =
  moves { left
          do! lr
          left 
          do! lr }

The best way to understand how expressions are desugared is probably to look at the <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec.html#_Toc335818835"">spec</a> (though it's a bit dense...).</p>

<p>There we can see that something like </p>

<pre><code>C {
    op1
    op2
}
</code></pre>

<p>gets desugared as follows:</p>

<pre><code>T([&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op1; [&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op2, [], fun v -&gt; v, true) ⇒
CL([&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op1; [&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op2, [], C.Yield(), false) ⇒
CL([&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op2, [], 〚 [&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op1, C.Yield() |][], false) ⇒
CL([&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op2, [], C.Op1(C.Yield()), false) ⇒
〚 [&lt;CustomOperator&gt;]op2, C.Op1(C.Yield()) 〛[] ⇒
C.Op2(C.Op1(C.Yield()))
</code></pre>

<p>As to why <code>Yield()</code> is used rather than <code>Zero</code>, it's because if there were variables in scope (e.g. because you used some <code>lets</code>, or were in a for loop, etc.), then you would get <code>Yield (v1,v2,...)</code> but <code>Zero</code> clearly can't be used this way.  Note that this means adding a superfluous <code>let x = 1</code> into Tomas's <code>lr</code> example will fail to compile, because <code>Yield</code> will be called with an argument of type <code>int</code> rather than <code>unit</code>.</p>

<p>There's another trick which can help understand the compiled form of computation expressions, which is to (ab)use the auto-quotation support for computation expressions in F# 3.  Just define a do-nothing <code>Quote</code> member and make <code>Run</code> just return its argument:</p>

<pre><code>member __.Quote() = ()
member __.Run(q) = q
</code></pre>

<p>Now your computation expression will evaluate to the quotation of its desugared form.  This can be pretty handy when debugging things.</p>

<p>I use it coupled with query objects so I do not have a coupling to any particular technology in my applications. And also it eases testing a lot.</p>

<p>So, I tend to have</p>

<pre><code>public interface IRepository : IDisposable
{
    void Save&lt;TEntity&gt;(TEntity entity);
    void SaveList&lt;TEntity&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;TEntity&gt; entities);

    void Delete&lt;TEntity&gt;(TEntity entity);
    void DeleteList&lt;TEntity&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;TEntity&gt; entities);

    IList&lt;TEntity&gt; GetAll&lt;TEntity&gt;() where TEntity : class;
    int GetCount&lt;TEntity&gt;() where TEntity : class;

    void StartConversation();
    void EndConversation();

    //if query objects can be self sustaining (i.e. not need additional configuration - think session), there is no need to include this method in the repository.
    TResult ExecuteQuery&lt;TResult&gt;(IQueryObject&lt;TResult&gt; query);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Possibly add async methods with callbacks as delegates. 
The repo is easy to implement <strong>generically</strong>, so I am able not to touch a line of the implementation from app to app. Well, this is true at least when using NH, I did it also with EF, but made me hate EF. 4. The conversation is the start of a transaction. Very cool if a few classes share the repository instance. Also, for NH, one repo in my implementation equals one session which is opened at the first request.</p>

<p>Then the Query Objects</p>

<pre><code>public interface IQueryObject&lt;TResult&gt;
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;Provides configuration options.&lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;remarks&gt;
    /// If the query object is used through a repository this method might or might not be called depending on the particular implementation of a repository.
    /// If not used through a repository, it can be useful as a configuration option.
    /// &lt;/remarks&gt;
    void Configure(object parameter);

    /// &lt;summary&gt;Implementation of the query.&lt;/summary&gt;
    TResult GetResult();
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the configure I use in NH only to pass in the ISession. In EF makes no sense more or less. </p>

<p>An example query would be.. (NH)</p>

<pre><code>public class GetAll&lt;TEntity&gt; : AbstractQueryObject&lt;IList&lt;TEntity&gt;&gt;
    where TEntity : class
{
    public override IList&lt;TEntity&gt; GetResult()
    {
        return this.Session.CreateCriteria&lt;TEntity&gt;().List&lt;TEntity&gt;();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To do an EF query you would have to have the context in the Abstract base, not the session. But of course the ifc would be the same.</p>

<p>In this way the queries are themselves encapsulated, and easily testable. Best of all, my code relies only on interfaces. Everything is very clean. Domain (business) objects are just that, e.g. there is no mixing of responsibilities like when using the active record pattern which is hardly testable and mixes data access (query) code in the domain object and in doing so is mixing concerns (object which fetches itself??). Everybody is still free to create POCOs for data transfer. </p>

<p>All in all, much code reuse and simplicity is provided with this approach at the loss of not anything I can imagine. Any ideas?</p>

<p>And thanks a lot to Ayende for his great posts and continued dedication. Its his ideas here (query object), not mine. </p>

"17449231","2","","14110890","2013-07-03 13:23:37","15","","<p>The repository pattern is an <strong><em>abstraction</em></strong>. It's purpose is to reduce complexity and make the rest of the code persistant ignorant. As a bonus it allows you to write <em>unit</em> tests instead of <em>integration</em> tests.</p>

<p>The problem is that many developers fail to understand the patterns purpose and create repositories which leak persistance specific information up to the caller (typically by exposing <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code>). By doing so they get no benefit over using the OR/M directly.</p>

<h2>Update to address another answer</h2>

<p><strong>Coding for the exception</strong></p>

<p>Using repositories is not about being able to switch persistence technology (i.e. changing database or using a webservice etc instead). It's about separating business logic from persistence to reduce complexity and coupling.</p>

<p><strong>Unit tests vs integration tests</strong> </p>

<p>You do not write unit tests for repositories. period.</p>

<p>But by introducing repositories (or any other abstraction layer between persistance and business) you are able to write unit tests for the business logic. i.e. you do not have to worry about your tests failing due to an incorrectly configured database.</p>

<p>As for the queries. If you use LINQ you also have to make sure that your queries work, just as you have to do with repositories. and that is done using integration tests.</p>

<p>The difference is that if you have not mixed your business with LINQ statements you can be 100% sure that it's your persistence code that are failing and not something else.</p>

<p>If you analyze your tests you will also see that they are much cleaner if you have not mixed concerns (i.e. LINQ + Business logic)</p>

<p><strong>Repository examples</strong></p>

<p>Most examples are bullshit. that is very true. However, if you google any design pattern you will find a lot of crappy examples. That is no reason to avoid using a pattern.</p>

<p>Building a correct repository implementation is very easy. In fact, you only have to follow a single rule: </p>

<p><strong><em>Do not add anything into the repository class until the very moment that you need it</em></strong> </p>

<p>A lot of coders are lazy and tries to make a generic repository and use a base class with a lot of methods that they <strong><em>might</em></strong> need. YAGNI. You write the repository class once and keep it as long as the application lives (can be years). Why fuck it up by being lazy. Keep it clean without any base class inheritance. It will make it much easier to read and maintain. </p>

<p><em>(The above statement is a guideline and not a law. A base class can very well be motivated. Just think before you add it, so that you add it for the right reasons)</em></p>

<h2>Old stuff</h2>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>If you don't mind having LINQ statements in your business code nor care about unit tests I see no reason to not use Entity Framework directly.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I've blogged both about the repository pattern and what ""abstraction"" really means: <a href=""http://blog.gauffin.org/2013/01/repository-pattern-done-right/"">http://blog.gauffin.org/2013/01/repository-pattern-done-right/</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For single entity type with 20+ fields, how will you design query method to support any permutation combination? You dont want to limit search only by name, what about searching with navigation properties, list all orders with item with specific price code, 3 level of navigation property search. The whole reason <code>IQueryable</code> was invented was to be able to compose any combination of search against database. Everything looks great in theory, but user's need wins above theory. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again: An entity with 20+ fields is incorrectly modeled. It's a GOD entity. Break it down. </p>

<p>I'm not arguing that <code>IQueryable</code> wasn't made for quering. <strong><em>I'm saying that it's not right for an abstraction layer like Repository pattern</em></strong> since it's leaky. There is no 100% complete LINQ To Sql provider (like EF). </p>

<p>They all have implementation specific things like how to use eager/lazy loading or how to do SQL ""IN"" statements. Exposing <code>IQueryable</code> in the repository forces the user to know all those things. Thus the whole attempt to abstract away the data source is a complete failure. You just add complexity without getting any benefit over using the OR/M directly.</p>

<p>Either implement Repository pattern correctly or just don't use it at all.</p>

<p><em>(If you really want to handle big entities you can combine the Repository pattern with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern"">Specification pattern</a>. That gives you a complete abstraction which also is testable.)</em></p>

People will argue about implementation details, but just as there are many ways to skin a cat, there are many ways to implement an abstraction.</p>

<p>Your question is specifically to use or not to use and why.</p>

<p>As you have no doubt realised you already have both these patterns built into Entity Framework, <code>DbContext</code> is the <code>UnitOfWork</code> and <code>DbSet</code> is the <code>Repository</code>. You don’t generally need to unit test the <code>UnitOfWork</code> or <code>Repository</code> themselves as they are simply facilitating between your classes and the underlying data access implementations. What you will find yourself needing to do, again and again, is mock these two abstractions when unit testing the logic of your services. </p>

<p>You can mock, fake or whatever with external libraries adding layers of code dependencies <strong>(that you don’t control)</strong> between the logic doing the testing and the logic being tested.</p>

<p>So a minor point is that <strong>having your own abstraction for <code>UnitOfWork</code> and <code>Repository</code> gives you maximum control and flexibility when mocking your unit tests.</strong></p>

<p>All very well, but for me, the real power of these abstractions is they provide a simple way to apply <strong>Aspect Oriented Programming techniques and adhere to the SOLID principles</strong>.</p>

<p>So you have your <code>IRepository</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IRepository&lt;T&gt;
    where T : class
{
    T Add(T entity);
    void Delete(T entity);
    IQueryable&lt;T&gt; AsQueryable();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And its implementation:</p>

<pre><code>public class Repository&lt;T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;
    where T : class
{
    private readonly IDbSet&lt;T&gt; _dbSet;
    public Repository(PPContext context) 
    {
        _dbSet = context.Set&lt;T&gt;();
    }

    public T Add(T entity)
    { 
        return _dbSet.Add(entity); 
    }

    public void Delete(T entity)
    {
        _dbSet.Remove(entity); 
    }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; AsQueryable() 
    {
        return _dbSet.AsQueryable();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary so far but now we want to add some logging - easy with a logging <em>Decorator</em>.</p>

<pre><code>public class RepositoryLoggerDecorator&lt;T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;
    where T : class
{
    Logger logger = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();
    private readonly IRepository&lt;T&gt; _decorated;
    public RepositoryLoggerDecorator(IRepository&lt;T&gt; decorated)
    {
        _decorated = decorated;
    }

    public T Add(T entity)
    {
        logger.Log(LogLevel.Debug, () =&gt; DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString() );
        T added = _decorated.Add(entity);
        logger.Log(LogLevel.Debug, () =&gt; DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());
        return added;
    }

    public void Delete(T entity)
    {
        logger.Log(LogLevel.Debug, () =&gt; DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());
        _decorated.Delete(entity);
        logger.Log(LogLevel.Debug, () =&gt; DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());
    }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; AsQueryable()
    {
        return _decorated.AsQueryable();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All done and <strong>with no change to our existing code</strong>. There are numerous other cross cutting concerns we can add, such as exception handling, data caching, data validation or whatever and throughout our design and build process <strong>the most valuable thing we have that enables us to add simple features without changing any of our existing code is our <code>IRepository</code> abstraction</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, many times I have seen this question on StackOverflow – “how do you make Entity Framework work in a multi tenant environment?”.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bentity-framework%5D+multi+tenant"">http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bentity-framework%5D+multi+tenant</a></p>

<p>If you have a <code>Repository</code> abstraction then the answer is “it’s easy add a decorator”</p>

<pre><code>public class RepositoryTennantFilterDecorator&lt;T&gt; : IRepository&lt;T&gt;
    where T : class
{
    //public for Unit Test example
    public readonly IRepository&lt;T&gt; _decorated;
    public RepositoryTennantFilterDecorator(IRepository&lt;T&gt; decorated)
    {
        _decorated = decorated;
    }

    public T Add(T entity)
    {
        return _decorated.Add(entity);
    }

    public void Delete(T entity)
    {
        _decorated.Delete(entity);
    }

    public IQueryable&lt;T&gt; AsQueryable()
    {
        return _decorated.AsQueryable().Where(o =&gt; true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>IMO you should always place a simple abstraction over any 3rd party component that will be referenced in more than a handful of places. From this perspective an ORM is the perfect candidate as it is referenced in so much of our code.</p>

<p>The answer that normally comes to mind when someone says “why should I have an abstraction (e.g. <code>Repository</code>) over this or that 3rd party library” is “why wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>P.S. Decorators are extremely simple to apply using an IoC Container, such as <a href=""http://simpleinjector.codeplex.com/"">SimpleInjector</a>.</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class IRepositoryTesting
{
    [Test]
    public void IRepository_ContainerRegisteredWithTwoDecorators_ReturnsDecoratedRepository()

<p><strong>Mockable Repository for Unit Tests, do we really need it?</strong></p>

<p>We let EF communicate to test DB in unit tests to test our business logic straight against SQL test DB. I don't see any benefit of having mock of any repository pattern at all. What is really wrong doing unit tests against test database?</p>

<p><strong>Unnecessary Abstraction</strong></p>

<p>Do you want to create repository just so that in future you can easily replace EF with NHbibernate etc or anything else? Sounds great plan, but is it really cost effective?</p>

<p><strong>Linq kills unit tests?</strong></p>

<p>I will like to see any examples on how it can kill.</p>

<p><strong>Dependency Injection, IoC</strong></p>

<p>Wow these are great words, sure they look great in theory, but sometimes you have to choose trade off between great design and great solution. We did use all of that, and we ended up throwing all at trash and choosing different approach. Size vs Speed (Size of code and Speed of development) matters huge in real life. Users need flexibility, they don't care if your code is great in design in terms of DI or IoC.</p>

<p><strong>Unless you are building Visual Studio</strong></p>

<p>All these great design are needed if you are building a complex program like Visual Studio or Eclipse which will be developed by many people and it needs to be highly customizable. All great development pattern came into picture after years of development these IDEs has gone through, and they have evolved at place where all these great design patterns matter so much. But if you are doing simple web based payroll, or simple business app, it is better that you evolve in your development with time, instead of spending time to build it for million users where it will be only deployed for 100s of users.</p>

<p><strong>Repository as Filtered View - ISecureRepository</strong></p>

<p>On other side, repository should be a filtered view of EF which guards access to data by applying necessary filler based on current user/role.</p>

<p>But doing so complicates repository even more as it ends up in huge code base to maintain. People end up creating different repositories for different user types or combination of entity types. Not only this, we also end up with lots of DTOs.</p>

<p>Following answer is an example implementation of Filtered Repository without creating whole set of classes and methods. It may not answer question directly but it can be useful in deriving one.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am author of Entity REST SDK.</p>

<p><a href=""http://entityrestsdk.codeplex.com"">http://entityrestsdk.codeplex.com</a></p>

<p>Keeping above in mind, we developed a SDK which creates repository of filtered view based on SecurityContext which holds filters for CRUD operations. And only two kinds of rules simplify any complex operations. First is access to entity, and other is Read/Write rule for property.</p>

<p>The advantage is, that you do not rewrite business logic or repositories for different user types, you just simply block or grant them the access. </p>

<pre><code>public class DefaultSecurityContext : BaseSecurityContext {

  public static DefaultSecurityContext Instance = new DefaultSecurityContext();

  // UserID for currently logged in User
  public static long UserID{
       get{
             return long.Parse( HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name );
       }
  }

  public DefaultSecurityContext(){
  }

  protected override void OnCreate(){

        // User can access his own Account only
        var acc = CreateRules&lt;Account&gt;();

        acc.SetRead( y =&gt; x=&gt; x.AccountID == UserID ) ;
        acc.SetWrite( y =&gt; x=&gt; x.AccountID == UserID );

        // User can only modify AccountName and EmailAddress fields
        acc.SetProperties( SecurityRules.ReadWrite, 
              x =&gt; x.AccountName,
              x =&gt; x.EmailAddress);

        // User can read AccountType field
        acc.SetProperties&lt;Account&gt;( SecurityRules.Read, 
              x =&gt; x.AccountType);

        // User can access his own Orders only
        var order = CreateRules&lt;Order&gt;();
        order.SetRead( y =&gt; x =&gt; x.CustomerID == UserID );

        // User can modify Order only if OrderStatus is not complete
        order.SetWrite( y =&gt; x =&gt; x.CustomerID == UserID 
            &amp;&amp; x.OrderStatus != ""Complete"" );

        // User can only modify OrderNotes and OrderStatus
        order.SetProperties( SecurityRules.ReadWrite, 
              x =&gt; x.OrderNotes,
              x =&gt; x.OrderStatus );

        // User can not delete orders
        order.SetDelete(order.NotSupportedRule);
  }
}

"20159814","2","","14110890","2013-11-23 07:31:36","29","","<p>I've gone down many paths and created many implementations of repositories on different projects and... I've thrown the towel in and given up on it, here's why. </p>

<p><strong>Coding for the exception</strong></p>

<p>Do you code for the 1% chance your database is going to change from one technology to another? If you're thinking about your business's future state and say yes that's a possibility then a) they must have a lot of money to afford to do a migration to another DB technology or b) you're choosing a DB technology for fun or c) something has gone horribly wrong with the first technology you decided to use.</p>

<p><strong>Why throw away the rich LINQ syntax?</strong></p>

<p>LINQ and EF were developed so you could do neat stuff with it to read and traverse object graphs. Creating and maintain a repository that can give you the same flexibility to do that is a monstrous task. In my experience any time I've created a repository I've <strong>ALWAYS</strong> had business logic leak into the repository layer to either make queries more perform-ant and/or reduce the number of hits to the database.</p>

<p>I don't want to create a method for every single permutation of a query that I have to write. I might as well write stored procedures. I don't want GetOrder, GetOrderWithOrderItem, GetOrderWithOrderItemWithOrderActivity, GetOrderByUserId, and so on... I just want to get the main entity and traverse and include the object graph as I so please.</p>

<p><strong>Most examples of repositories are bullshit</strong> </p>

<p>Unless you are developing something REALLY bare-bones like a blog or something your queries are never going to be as simple as 90% of the examples you find on the internet surrounding the repository pattern. I cannot stress this enough! This is something that one has to crawl through the mud to figure out. There will always be that one query that breaks your perfectly thought out repository/solution that you've created, and its not until that point where you 2nd guess yourself and the technical debt/erosion begins.</p>

<p><strong>Don't unit test me bro</strong></p>

<p>But what about unit testing if I don't have a repository? How will I mock? Simple you don't. Lets look at it from both angles:</p>

<p>No repository - You can mock the DbContext using an IDbContext or some other tricks but then you're really unit testing LINQ to Objects and not LINQ to Entities because the query is determined at runtime... OK so that's not good! So now its up to the integration test to cover this.</p>

<p>With repository - You can now mock your repositories and unit test the layer(s) in between. Great right? Well not really... In the cases above where you have to leak logic into the repository layer to make queries more perform-ant and/or less hits to the database, how can your unit tests cover that? It's now in the repo layer and you don't want to test IQueryable right? Also lets be honest, your unit tests aren't going to cover the queries that have a 20 line <code>.Where()</code> clause and <code>.Include()</code>'s a bunch of relationships and hits the database again to do all this other stuff, blah, blah, blah anyway's because the query is generated at runtime. Also since you created a repository to keep the upper layers persistence ignorant, if you now you want to change your database technology, sorry your unit tests are defiantly not going to guarantee the same results at runtime, back to integration tests. So the whole point of the repository seems weird..</p>

<p><strong>2 cents</strong></p>

<p>We already lose a lot of functionality and syntax when using EF over plain stored procedures (bulk inserts, bulk deletes, CTE's, etc.) but I also code in C# so I don't have to type binary. We use EF so we can have the possibility of using different providers and to work with object graphs in a nice related way amongst many things. Certain abstractions are useful and some are not.</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone on the internets somewhere...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.MULTIWINDOW_LAUNCHER"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to define the dimensions above in a resource file.</p>

<p>In the comments section of that blog post a user mentions that the minimum size was causing a problem for him and suggested removing <code>com.sec.android.multiwindow.MINIMUM_SIZE_W</code> and <code>com.sec.android.multiwindow.MINIMUM_SIZE_H</code>.</p>

I don't believe that it is currently possible to do what you propose because there are no initializers in UIStoryboard that allow overriding the view controller associated with the storyboard as defined in the object details in the storyboard on initialization.  It's at initialization that all the UI elements in the stoaryboard are linked up to their properties in the view controller.</p>

<p>It will by default initialize with the view controller that is specified in the storyboard definition.</p>

<p>If you are trying to gain reuse of UI elements you created in the storyboard, they still must be linked or associated to properties in which ever view controller is using them for them to be able to ""tell"" the view controller about events.</p>

<p>It's not that much of a big deal copying over a storyboard layout especially if you only need a similar design for 3 views, however if you do, you must make sure that all the previous associations are cleared, or it will get crashes when it tries to communicate to the previous view controller.  You will be able to recognize them as KVO error messages in the log output.</p>

<p>A couple of approaches you could take:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>store the UI elements in a UIView - in a xib file and instantiate it from your base class and add it as a sub view in the main view, typically self.view.  The you would simply use the storyboard layout with basically blank view controllers holding their place in the storyboard but with the correct view controller sub class assigned to them.  Since they would inherit from the base, they would get that view.</p></li>
<li><p>create the layout in code and install it from your base view controller. Obviously this approach defeats the purpose of using the storyboard, but may be the way to go in your case.  If you have other parts of the app that would benefit from the storyboard approach, it's ok to  deviate here and there if appropriate.  In this case, like above, you would just use bank view controllers with your subclass assigned and let the base view controller install the UI.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice if Apple came up with a way to do what you propose, but the issue of having the graphic elements pre-linked with the controller subclass would still be an issue.</p>

be well</p>

<p>Adobe invented PDF and it invented the Acrobat product family to be used together with it. The different PDF versions were released together with major Acrobat versions (PDF 1.3 for example was released together with Acrobat 4).</p>

<p>Because of the adoption of the PDF format and because a number of ISO standards were written that actually depended on the proprietary PDF file format (not an easy thing for an ISO standard), Adobe decided to hand over the PDF format to ISO.</p>

<p>From that point on and until today there is an ISO committee responsible for editing the PDF specification and coming up with new versions. The ISO standard for PDF is ISO 32000.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that, depending on where you want to use PDF, a number of other ISO standards might be very useful or indispensable. Amongst the most commonly used are PDF/X (for exchange of PDF files in the publishing community) and PDF/A (for the creation of PDF files that need to be archived in long-term storage). These specifications reference a specific version of the PDF standard and add additional requirements and restrictions.</p>

<p>As far as the specification is concerned, you can get all documents from the ISO directly. However, for PDF itself you can also get it from Adobe and that document will be identical. Refer to the Adobe DevNet site on Acrobat:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat.html"">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat.html</a></p>

<p>Just download the Acrobat SDK and that will give you the documentation as part of it.</p>

<p>Let me add a word of caution on ""targeting the PDF specification"" in code. I really, really, really advise you to more clearly specify exactly what your needs are for PDF (editing, generating, quality control (preflight)) and then look for or ask about an existing library that meets those needs or can be extended to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Writing something that supports ""PDF"" in general will be a daunting task. The PDF specification is large, intricate and full of... well... niceties. There be dragons!</p>

</ul>

<p>The content of this document later became officially adopted as the ISO standard for general PDF, ISO 32000-1.</p>

<p>Note however, that there are a few differences to the PDF file available from ISO:</p>

<ul>
<li>The page layout changed, compared to Adobe's version.</li>

<p><em>But it's not necessarily benign</em>. Such a statement can perform actions and/or alter state due to methods which cause side effects, and optionally evaluate those methods due to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation"">short-circuiting of operators</a>.</p>

<pre><code>if( a() &amp;&amp; b() );
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>a()</code> or <code>b()</code> may do something, and <code>b()</code> will only execute if <code>a()</code> is true.</p>

<p>As to <em>why</em>, I think the answer is simply that it would be worse to deviate from defined, expected behavior (e.g. statements like <code>while(reader.read());</code>) than the alternative of developers writing bad code. </p>

<p>Writing bad code is always possible. And just to reiterate, this would be bad code in almost any case.</p>

<p>Basically, the comma was used as the list item separator, so the semicolon was used as the ""list of statements"" separator.  The downside is in the handling of null items in lists, and null statements in blocks.</p>

<p>In a list of items, Java uses the explicit keyword <code>null</code>, but a ""null statement"" is just an empty line.  Allowing the existence of an empty line is a holdover from tradition inherited from C.</p>

<p>Why do it?  Especially with an <code>if</code> statement when you know that no statements are being executed:  Because some if statements have side effects:</p>

<pre><code> int c;
 if ((c = in.read()) != -1);
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, it is not the best example, but basically it says read a byte from the stream and do nothing.  Might be useful in some corner cases, but even if this example isn't the best, it illustrates the intent.  We want to feel the side-effects of the expression without accidentally executing any statements.</p>

"14115042","2","","14112515","2013-01-01 23:02:28","0","","<p>Java allows an empty block any place a statement block is allowed.  I am sure making this a general rule for all blocks simplifies the compiler.</p>

<p>I agree that this is primarily the cause of bugs that are spectacularly hard to find.  I always use braces around blocks, even when there is a single statement, but Java allows you to make a block with braces at any point, so using braces can not save you from this fate.  For example, I once wasted 4 hours trying find something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (condition);
{
    statement;
    statement;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The semicolon at the end of the first line was a typo, accidentally making the statement block for the while loop empty.  Because the syntax is valid the program compiled and ran fine, just not the way I wanted it to.  It was <em>really</em> hard to find.</p>

<p>I can think of one situation where it is <em>very nice</em> that you are allowed to have empty blocks, and this is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (condition1) {
    do_action_1();
}
else if (condition2) {
    //nothing really to do in this case
}
else if (condition3) {
    do_action2();
}
else {
    do_action3();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, you want to be able to separate out various conditions.  Remember, those conditions might be overlapping, so it is not always possible to rearrange the order.  If one of the conditions really does not need anything done, then it is nice that Java allows you to have an empty block.  Otherwise, the language would need some form of a ""noop"" method to use when you really do not want anything done.  </p>

<p>I personally would prefer the explicit ""noop"" statement -- but that is not how Java is defined.</p>

<li>they're inefficient. Instead of simply hashing an integer, the database needs to hash a composite of 3 columns.</li>
<li>they lead to bugs: developers inevitably implement the equals and hashCode methods of the primary key class incorrectly. Or they make it mutable, and modify their value once stored i a HashSet or HashMap</li>

<p>In your business model, today it can be convenient to identify a record by some of its data, but business models evolves in time. And when this happens, you'll find that your natural key doesn't fit anymore to uniquely identify your data. And with referential integrity in other tables, this will make things <strong>MUCH</strong> harder to change.</p>

<p>Having a surrogate PK is convenient because it doesn't chain <em>how your data is identified in your storage</em> with <em>your business model structure</em>.</p>

<p>Natural keys cannot be generated from a sequence, and the case of data which cannot be identified by its data is <em>much</em> more frequent. This is an evidence that natural keys differ from a storage key, and they cannot be taken as a general (and good) approach.</p>

<p>Using surrogate keys simplifies the design of the application and database. They are easier to use, are more performant, and do a perfect job. </p>

<p>Natural keys bring only disadvantages: I cannot think of a single advantage for using natural keys.</p>

<p>That said, I think hibernate has no real issues with natural (composed) keys. But you'll probably find some problems (or bugs) sometimes, and issues with the documentation or trying to get help, because the hibernate community widely acknowledges the benefits of surrogate keys. So, prepare a good answer for <em>why you did choose a composite key</em>.</p>

<p><strong>First of all</strong>, I want to be clear on the fact that <strong>both</strong> surrogate keys (artificial auto-generated ones) and natural keys (composed of column(s) with domain meaning) have <strong>pros</strong> and <strong>cons</strong>. I am not trying to say that one key type is better than the other. I am tying to say that depending on your requirements, natural keys might be a better choice than surrogate ones and vice versa.</p>

<h1>Myths on natural keys</h1>

<ol>
<li>Composite keys are less efficient than surrogate keys. No! It depends on the used database engine:
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:0%3a%3a%3a%3aP11_QUESTION_ID:6070436300346195032"">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1460465/composite-primary-key-performance-drawback-in-mysql"">MySQL</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Natural keys don't exist in real-life. Sorry but they do exist! In aviation industry, for example, the following tuple will be always unique regarding a given <strong>scheduled</strong> flight (airline, departureDate, flightNumber, operationalSuffix). More generally, when a set of business data is guaranteed to be unique by a given <strong>standard</strong> then this set of data is a [good] natural key candidate.</li>
<li>Natural keys ""pollute the schema"" of child tables. For me this is more a feeling than a real problem. Having a 4 columns primary-key of 2 bytes each might be more efficient than a single column of 11 bytes. Besides, the 4 columns can be used to query the child table directly (by using the 4 columns in a where clause) without joining to the parent table.  </li>
</ol>

<h1>Disadvantages of surrogate keys</h1>

<p>Surrogate keys are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Source of performance problems:
<ul>
<li>They are usually implemented using auto-incremented columns which mean:
<ul>
<li>A round-trip to the database each time you want to get a new Id (I know that this can be improved using caching or [seq]hilo alike algorithms but still those methods have their own drawbacks).</li>
<li>If one-day you need to move your data from one schema to another (It happens quite regularly in my company at least) then you might encounter Id collision problems. And Yes I know that you can use UUIDs but those lasts requires 32 hexadecimal digits! (If you care about database size then it can be an issue).</li>
<li>If you are using one sequence for all your surrogate keys then - for sure - you will end up with contention on your database.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Error prone. A sequence has a max_value limit so - as a developer - you have to put attention to the following facts:
<ul>
<li>You must cycle your sequence ( when the max-value is reached it goes back to 1,2,...).</li>
<li>If you are using the sequence as an ordering (over time) of your data then you must handle the case of cycling (column with Id 1 might be newer than row with Id max-value - 1).</li>
<li>Make sure that your code (and even your client interfaces which should not happen as it supposed to be an internal Id) supports 32b/64b integers that you used to store your sequence values.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>They don't guarantee non duplicated data. You can always have 2 rows with all the same column values but with a different generated value. For me this is <strong>THE</strong> problem of surrogate keys from a database design point of view.</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key"">More in Wikipedia...</a></li>
</ol>

<h1>Why Hibernate prefers/needs surrogate keys ?</h1>

<p>As stated in <strong>Java Persistence with Hibernate</strong> reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More experienced Hibernate users use saveOrUpdate() exclusively; it’s
  much easier to let Hibernate decide what is new and what is old,
  especially in a more complex network of objects with mixed state. The
  only (not really serious) disadvantage of exclusive saveOrUpdate() is
  that it sometimes can’t guess whether an instance is old or new
  without firing a SELECT at the database—for example, when a class is
  mapped with a natural composite key and no version or timestamp
  property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some manifestations of the <strong>limitation</strong> (This is how, I think, we should call it) can be found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3742897/hibernate-elementcollection-strange-delete-insert-behavior"">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Please don't be too squared on your opinions. Use natural keys when it is relevant to do so and use surrogate keys when it is better to use them.</p>

<p>Hope that this helped someone!</p>

<p>Special care does need to be made for Data Warehousing and OLAP style systems however, that utilize a massive Fact Table to tie surrogate keys of dimensions together.  In this case the data dictates the dashboard/application that can be used to maintain records.</p>

<p>So instead of one method being preferable to another, perhaps it is one directive is advantageous to another, for key construction : You won't be developing a Hibernate app very easily to harness direct access to an SSAS system instance.</p>

<p>I develop using both key mixtures, and feel to implement a solid star or snowflake pattern a surrogate with clustered index is typically my first choice.</p>

<p>So, to the regards of the OP and others looking by: if you want to stay db invariant with your development (which Hibernate specializes in) -- utilize the surrogate method, and when data reads tend to slow, or you notice certain queries drain performance, revert to your specific database, and add composite, clustered indices that optimize query order.</p>

There are <code>map.js</code> - map layer for offline tiles, <code>storage.js</code> - storage implementation based on IndexedDb and WebSQL (but this just test implementation with poor performance).</p>

<ul>
<li>For site files (html, css, js and etc.) I prefer use application cache.</li>
<li>For storage I prefer use Indexed DB (support blob), Web SQL (only base64), FileWriter (support blob, but only chrome). Frankly storage is big issue for this. You need the fastest key value solution that will mix them all. I think is good decision to use exist solution.</li>
<li>For fetching I used canvas with CORS. But I thinking about WebWorkers and XHR2 and this can be better instead canvas because canvas have some troubles with CORS in different browsers and other (for example <a href=""http://tile.openstreetmap.org/14/9445/5267.png"" rel=""nofollow"">this title</a> was stored <a href=""http://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7a/129/0b9/d7a1290b9987e3703ce7f4c3f10d573e.png"" rel=""nofollow"">bad in opera</a>).</li>

I've ended up by implementing the solution I've described here: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2013/09/24/using-indexeddb-to-handle-your-3d-webgl-assets-sharing-feedbacks-amp-tips-of-babylon-js.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2013/09/24/using-indexeddb-to-handle-your-3d-webgl-assets-sharing-feedbacks-amp-tips-of-babylon-js.aspx</a> for storing the textures and 3d meshes of our 3D WebL engine. I'm referecing this stackoverflow thread inside this article.</p>

<p>I hope that this article will be useful to some of you and I hope that Chrome will soon support storing blob into IndexedDB. I didn't really look to the available polyfills using FileSystem API. Did anybody try such polyfills?</p>

<pre><code>cd $(brew --prefix)
rm Library/Formula/argp-standalone.rb
rm Library/Formula/cocot.rb
</code></pre>

<p>And then do the</p>

<pre><code>git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
brew update
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, to explain a bit more:</p>

<pre><code>cd $(brew --prefix)
</code></pre>

<p>tells <code>cd</code> to change the directory to whatever <code>brew --prefix</code> will output. 
If you try executing <code>brew --prefix</code> command you should see something in lines of:</p>

<pre><code>brew --prefix
/usr/local
</code></pre>

<p>So the command would be in this case an equivalent of <code>cd /usr/local</code>.
Newer <code>brew</code> versions have formulae under its installation prefix and <code>Library/Formula/</code>, so that's where you need to look for those outdated/changed files.</p>

<p>Note, that if you changed those formulae yourself for a particular reason (like pinning a version) this action will revert them back to default ones and may produce unwanted effects.</p>

<p>@TedPennings noted in comments that this worked for him, but his sequence was:</p>

<ol>
<li>chown everything to <code>my_username:admin</code>, ie, <code>sudo chown -R ted:admin $(brew --prefix)</code></li>
<li>run the two git commands above,<code>git fetch origin</code> and <code>git reset --hard origin/master</code></li>

<p>The brew update command performs a <code>git pull</code>, so if there are any changed files (or even file attributes, which happened to me when I changed permissions in the directory recursively) you have to somehow fix the conflicts. Using <code>git stash</code> is one way; it takes any changes and puts them aside so you effectively revert to the last updated repo version. The Homebrew 'location' is by default <code>/usr/local</code> and it installs as a git repository. You can look for a <code>.git</code> folder to see for yourself.

"14162208","2","","14113559","2013-01-04 17:49:35","21","","<p>You can use <a href=""http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/"">YAML front matter</a> to tune anything you want for any post/page. Any info you provide there would be accessible through in layouts and includes under <code>page</code> variable or under specific post in any list of them.</p>

<p>This sounds like a solution for your case: you could use YAML front matter like this:</p>

<pre><code>---
extra_css:
  - foo.css
  - dir/bar.css
  - /s/baz.css
---
</code></pre>

<p>And then use this in your layout's header like this:</p>

<pre><code>{% for css_name in page.extra_css %}
    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ css_name }}""&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>In such way you could add any logic based on what data you provide with a post in YAML front matter.</p>

<p>If you'd like to abstract some of those logic to modules, you can use a hack around the includes, assigning a variable before that include and then using it inside. <a href=""http://jekyllbootstrap.com/api/bootstrap-api.html"">Here is a link</a> with a description how it's made in Jekyll Bootstrap project (btw, the site for it have a lot of nice info on Jekyll).</p>

<p>And, yes, Jekyll don't allow the use of variables in includes, so if you'd like to include something conditionally, you would need a list of all available includes somewhere and then create all the conditions for inserting one or another when you'll need them.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another solution is to divide everything in layout to includes, and make layouts with different levels of complexity — this way you could set any of those basic layouts for post and then write any extra code with includes of any blocks you'll need from the basic layouts, so you post could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>---
layout: custom
---
&lt;aside class=""sidebar""&gt;
    {% include comments.html %}
    {% include sidebar.html %}
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;div class=""content"" role=""main""&gt;
    Foo bar baz
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There you could use a custom layout that don't include a basic layout for page and don't include the sidebar and comments, so you could per-post decide what level of layout you want and then redefine anything that needed to be redefined.</p>

<p>Also, if you'll need to tweak different places but with an unknown content, you could use YAML front matter with blocks, like </p>

<pre><code>extra_head: |
    &lt;style&gt;
    * {background: red}
    &lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then you could call such variable from head: <code>{{ page.extra_head }}</code> and get any content you placed there. However, you can't use any liquid tags inside YAML, but you could then use any YAML tags on such variables, so you could markdownify them or replace any strings inside with anything else by simple replace filter.</p>

<p>And if nothing of those fit you, then Jekyll won't fit you — as I wrote in a comment, Jekyll is just a blog engine and you shouldn't wait it to be complex as XSLT.</p>

<p>The rationale for the above functions (which I find <em>way</em> inefficient - the one below is better) is that a service that shall not be named apparently ran spelling checks and keyword recognition on the URLs.</p>

<p>After losing a long time on a customer's paranoias, I found out they were <em>not</em> imagining things after all -- their SEO experts [I am definitely not one] reported that, say, converting ""Viaggi Economy Perù"" to <code>viaggi-economy-peru</code> ""behaved better"" than <code>viaggi-economy-per</code> (the previous ""cleaning"" removed UTF8 characters; <strong>Bogotà</strong> became <strong>bogot</strong>, <strong>Medellìn</strong> became <strong>medelln</strong> and so on).</p>

<p>There were also some common misspellings that seemed to influence the results, and the only explanation that makes sense to me is that our URL are being unpacked, the words singled out, and used to drive God knows what ranking algorithms. And those algorithms apparently have been fed with UTF8-cleaned strings, so that ""Perù"" becomes ""Peru"" instead of ""Per"".</p>

<p>In order to both keep UTF8 characters and replace some misspellings, the faster function below became the more accurate (?) function above. <code>$dict</code> needs to be hand tailored, of course.</p>

<h1>Previous answer</h1>

<p>A simple approach:</p>

<pre><code>// Remove all characters except A-Z, a-z, 0-9, dots, hyphens and spaces
// Note that the hyphen must go last not to be confused with a range (A-Z)
// and the dot, being special, is escaped with \
$str = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9\. -]/', '', $str);

// Replace sequences of spaces with hyphen
$str = preg_replace('/  */', '-', $str);

// The above means ""a space, followed by a space repeated zero or more times""
// (should be equivalent to / +/)

// You may also want to try this alternative:
$str = preg_replace('/\\s+/', '-', $str);

// where \s+ means ""zero or more whitespaces"" (a space is not necessarily the
// same as a whitespace) just to be sure and include everything
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you might have to first <code>urldecode()</code> the URL, since %20 and + both are actually spaces - I mean, if you have ""Never%20gonna%20give%20you%20up"" you want it to become Never-gonna-give-you-up, not <em>Never20gonna20give20you20up</em> . You might not need it, but I thought I'd mention the possibility.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the HTTPS site's certificate is signed by a trusted root certificate then it will work out of the box without a custom <code>SSLSocketFactory</code>.
The trusted root certificates CAN be different to that used by a browser so don't assume that if it works in the Android web browser then it will work in your app.<br>
If it's not a trusted root certificate and you get exceptions like <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: org.bouncycastle.jce.exception.ExtCertPathValidatorException: Could not validate certificate signature.</code>, then you need to create and load a key store as below.</p></li>
<li><p>The key store needs to be generated using the Bouncy Castle provider (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/5187509/588306"">1</a>) by specifying <code>-storetype bks</code> on the <code>keytool</code> command line.<br>
If Bouncy Castle is not installed correctly then this will fail with various exceptions including <code>java.security.KeyStoreException: BKS not found</code>.
If the key store is not created with the Bouncy Castle provider then you may get the <code>java.io.IOException: Wrong version of key store.</code> exception, causing confusion with the next case.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to use an appropriate version (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/10809108/588306"">1</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/14116462/588306"">2</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7002670/588306"">3</a>) of the Bouncy Castle provider.

This can be put into your JRE's <code>lib/ext/</code> folder and the class name added to <code>lib/security/java.security</code>, or specified directly on the command line to <code>keytool</code>.
If it's an incompatible version (or store type) you will get exceptions along the lines of <code>java.io.IOException: Wrong version of key store.</code> again.</p></li>
<li><p>You must include all intermediary and the root certificate. If any are missing, you will get a <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.</code> exception.</p></li>
<li><p>The certificate chain MUST be in order for them to be validated correctly. If they aren't you will either get <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: org.bouncycastle.jce.exception.ExtCertPathValidatorException: IssuerName(CN=XYZ) does not match SubjectName(CN=ABC) of signing certificate.</code> or again, a generic <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.</code>
I have not found a way to order them in the key store so resorted to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/4115101/588306"">doing it in code at runtime</a>.</p></li>

<pre><code>eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --no-grab --write-env-file $HOME/.gpg-agent-info)
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_AGENT_INFO

<blockquote>
  <p>Async void event handlers in web forms are only supported on certain
  events, as you've found, but are really only intended for simplistic
  tasks. We recommend using PageAsyncTask for any async work of any real
  complexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Levi Broderick from the ASP.NET team gave this answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Async events in web applications are inherently strange beasts.  Async
  void is meant for a fire and forget programming model.  This works in
  Windows UI applications since the application sticks around until the
  OS kills it, so whenever the async callback runs there is guaranteed
  to be a UI thread that it can interact with.  In web applications,
  this model falls apart since requests are by definition transient.  If
  the async callback happens to run after the request has finished,
  there is no guarantee that the data structures the callback needs to
  interact with are still in a good state.  Thus why fire and forget
  (and async void) is inherently a bad idea in web applications.</p>
  
  <p>That
  said, we do crazy gymnastics to try to make very simple things like
  Page_Load work, but the code to support this is extremely complicated
  and not well-tested for anything beyond basic scenarios.  So if you
  need reliability I’d stick with RegisterAsyncTask.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think the answer to my question is: ""That's the wrong question."" </p>

<p>The right question would be ""How should I be async in my ASP.NET Web Forms application?"" And the answer is to insert this snippet inside your aspx code-behind file:</p>

<pre><code>this.RegisterAsyncTask(new PageAsyncTask(async cancellationToken =&gt; {
    var result = await SomeOperationAsync(cancellationToken);
    // do something with result.
}));
</code></pre>

<p>This same trick works inside ASP.NET custom controls, just use <code>this.Page.RegisterAsyncTask</code> instead.</p>

<p>Here's what I see:</p>

<ul>
<li>I understand why you want to use 'ng-model' but in your case it's not necessary.  ng-model is to link <em>existing</em> html elements with a value in the scope.  Since you're creating a directive yourself you're creating a 'new' html element, so you don't need ng-model.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> As mentioned by Mark in his comment, there's no reason that you <em>can't</em> use ng-model, just to keep with convention.</p>

<ul>
<li>By explicitly creating a scope in your directive (an 'isolated' scope), the directive's scope cannot access the 'name' variable on the parent scope (which is why, I think, you wanted to use ng-model).</li>
<li>I removed ngModel from your directive and replaced it with a custom name that you can change to whatever.</li>
<li>The thing that makes it all still work is that '=' sign in the scope.  Checkout the docs  <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive"">docs</a> under the 'scope' header.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, your directives should use the isolated scope (which you did correctly) and use the '=' type scope if you want a value in your directive to always map to a value in the parent scope. </p>

<p><code>{}</code> is ambigious like that. Is it an empty block, or an empty object literal? It's failing because a comparison operator can not follow a block.</p>

<p>Wrapping it with parenthesis makes the parser treat it as an expression. An expression can't contain a block, so it knows it's an object.</p>

<p>...it's still true because variables which have an object assigned to them's values are a <em>pointer</em> to them and as a consequence, they are never copied around by their contents (though this is irrelevant to your example).

<p>This also implies that comparing two variables which point to the same object will work as expected, as their pointers will be the same.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>(range 2 20)</code> call is creating a new lazy list of numbers for every increment of <code>i</code>. This is expensive, and is causing lots of unnecessary GC.</li>
<li>You are doing a lot of boxing by passing through function calls. Even the <code>(iterate inc 1)</code> is doing boxing / unboxing at every increment.</li>
<li>You are traversing a sequence of divisors. This is slower than a straight iterative loop</li>
<li><code>mod</code> is actually not a very well optimised function in Clojure at present. You are much better off using <code>rem</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can solve the first problem by using a <code>let</code> statement to define the range just once:</p>

<pre><code>(time (let [rng (range 2 20)]
  (prn (some (fn [^long i] (has-all-divisors rng i)) (iterate inc 1)))))
=&gt; ""Elapsed time: 48863.801522 msecs""

<p>You can solve the second problem with loop/recur:</p>

<pre><code>(time (let [rng (range 2 20)
           f (fn [^long i] (has-all-divisors rng i))]
       (prn (loop [i 1] 
              (if (f i)
                i
                (recur (inc i)))))))
=&gt; ""Elapsed time: 32757.594957 msecs""
</code></pre>

<p>You can solve the third problem by using an iterative loop over the possible divisors:</p>

<pre><code>(defn has-all-divisors [^long num]
  (loop [d (long 2)]
    (if (zero? (mod num d))
      (if (&gt;= d 20) true (recur (inc d)))
      false)))

 (time (prn (loop [i (long 1)] (if (has-all-divisors i) i (recur (inc i))))))
 =&gt; ""Elapsed time: 13369.525651 msecs""
</code></pre>

<p>You can solve the final problem using <code>rem</code></p>

<pre><code>(defn has-all-divisors [^long num]
  (loop [d (long 2)]
    (if (== 0 (rem num d))
      (if (&gt;= d 20) true (recur (inc d)))
      false)))

 (time (prn (loop [i (long 1)] (if (has-all-divisors i) i (recur (inc i))))))
=&gt; ""Elapsed time: 2423.195407 msecs""

<p>As you can see, it is now competitive with the Java version. </p>

<p>In general, you can usually make Clojure almost as fast as Java with a bit of effort. The main tricks are usually:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid lazy functional features. They are nice, but add some overhead which can be problematic in low-level computation-intensive code.</li>
<li>Use primitive / unchecked maths</li>
<li>Use loop/recur rather than sequences</li>
<li>Ensure you are not doing any reflection on Java objects (i.e. <code>(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)</code> and eliminate all warnings you find)</li>

<p>Both keywords can be used in the declaration of objects as well as functions. The basic difference when applied to <em>objects</em> is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>const</code> declares an object as <em>constant</em>. This implies a guarantee that, once initialized, the value of that object won't change, and the compiler can make use of this fact for optimizations. It also helps prevent the programmer from writing code that modifies objects that were not meant to be modified after initialization.</p></li>
<li><p><code>constexpr</code> declares an object as fit for use in what the Standard calls <em>constant expressions</em>. But note that <code>constexpr</code> is not the only way to do this.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When applied to <em>functions</em> the basic difference is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>const</code> can only be used for non-static member functions, not functions in general. It gives a guarantee that the member function does not modify any of the non-static data members.</p></li>
<li><p><code>constexpr</code> can be used with both member and non-member functions, as well constructors. It declares the function fit for use in <em>constant expressions</em>. The compiler will only accept it if the function meets certain criteria (7.1.5/3,4), most importantly <sup>(&dagger;)</sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The function body must be non-virtual and extremely simple: Apart from typedefs and static asserts, only a single <code>return</code> statement is allowed. In the case of a constructor, only an initialization list, typedefs and static assert are allowed. (<code>= default</code> and <code>= delete</code> are allowed, too, though.)</li>
<li>The arguments and the return type must be <em>literal types</em> (i.e., generally speaking, very simple types, typically scalars or aggregates)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Constant expressions</h2>

<p>As said above, <code>constexpr</code> declares both objects as well as functions as fit for use in constant expressions. A constant expression is more than merely constant:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It can be used in places that require compile-time evaluation, for example, template parameters and array-size specifiers:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;int N&gt;
class fixed_size_list
{ /*...*/ };

fixed_size_list&lt;X&gt; mylist;     // &lt;-- X must be an integer constant expression

int numbers[X];   // &lt;-- X must be an integer constant expression
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>But note:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Declaring something as <code>constexpr</code> does not necessarily guarantee that it will be evaluated at compile time. It <em>can be used</em> for such, but it can be used in other places that are evaluated at run-time, as well.</p></li>
<li><p>An object <em>may</em> be fit for use in constant expressions <em>without</em> being declared <code>constexpr</code>. Example:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
  const int N = 3;

  int numbers[N] = { 1 , 2, 3 };   // &lt;-- N is constant expression
  /*...*/
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>This is possible because <code>N</code>, being constant and initialized at declaration time with a literal, satisfies the criteria for a constant expression, even if it isn't declared <code>constexpr</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So when do I actually have to use <code>constexpr</code>?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>An <strong>object</strong> like <code>N</code> above can be used as constant expression <em>without</em> being declared <code>constexpr</code>. This is true for all objects that are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>const</code></li>
<li>of integral or enumeration type <em>and</em></li>
<li>initialized at declaration time with an expression that is itself a constant expression
<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<p><sub>[This is due to §5.19/2: A constant expression must not include a subexpressions that involves ""an lvalue-to-rvalue modification unless [...] a glvalue of integral or enumeration type [...]"". Thanks to Richard Smith for correcting my earlier claim that this was true of all literal types]</sub></p></li>
<li><p>For a <strong>function</strong> to be fit for use in constant expressions, it <strong>must</strong> be explicitly declared <code>constexpr</code>; it is not sufficient for it merely to satisfy the criteria for constant-expression functions. Example:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;int N&gt;
class list
{ };

constexpr int sqr1(int arg)
{ return arg*arg; }

int sqr2(int arg)
{ return arg*arg; }

int main()
{
  const int X = 2;

  list&lt;sqr1(X)&gt; mylist1; // OK; sqr1 is constexpr
  list&lt;sqr2(X)&gt; mylist2; // Wrong; sqr2 is not constexpr

  return 0;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When can I / should I use both, <code>const</code> and <code>constexpr</code> <em>together?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>a) In object declarations</strong> This is never necessary when both keywords refer to the same object to be declared. <code>constexpr</code> implies <code>const</code>.</p>

<pre><code>constexpr const int N = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>constexpr int N = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>However, note that there may be situations when the keywords each refer to different parts of the declaration:</p>

<pre><code>static constexpr int N = 3;
int main()
{
  constexpr const int *NP = &amp;N;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>NP</code> is declared as an address constant-expression, i.e. an pointer that is itself a constant expression. (This is possible when the address is generated by applying the address operator to a static/global constant expression.) Here, both <code>constexpr</code> and <code>const</code> are required: <code>constexpr</code> always refers to the expression being declared (here <code>NP</code>), while <code>const</code> refers to <code>int</code> (it declares a pointer-to-const). Removing the <code>const</code> would render the expression illegal (because (a) a pointer to a non-const object cannot be a constant expression and (b) <code>&amp;N</code> is in-fact a pointer-to-constant).</p>

<p><strong>b) In member function declarations</strong> In C++11, <code>constexpr</code> implies <code>const</code> also for member functions. However, this is likely to change in C++14. According to the current drafts, <code>constexpr</code> will imply <code>const</code> <em>only for objects</em>, not for member functions, due to a proposed change to §7.1.5/8. Hence, a member function declared under C++11 as</p>

<pre><code>constexpr void f();
</code></pre>

<p>will have to be declared as</p>

<pre><code>constexpr void f() const;
</code></pre>

<p>under C++14 in order to still be usable as a <code>const</code> function. <strong>Best mark your <code>constexpr</code> member functions as <code>const</code> even now so as to avoid having to change a lot of code later on.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><sup>(&dagger;)</sup> The conditions for acceptable <code>constexpr</code> functions will probably be relaxed for C++14. A <a href=""http://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3652.html"">proposal by Richard Smith</a> has recently been <a href=""http://isocpp.org/blog/2013/04/n3652-relaxing-constraints-on-constexpr-functions"">adopted into the C++14 draft</a>.</p>

• <strong>const</strong>: meaning roughly ‘‘I promise not to change this value’’ (§7.5). This is used primarily
to specify interfaces, so that data can be passed to functions without fear of it being modified.<br>
The compiler enforces the promise made by const.<br>
• <strong>constexpr</strong>: meaning roughly ‘‘to be evaluated at compile time’’ (§10.4). This is used primarily to specify constants, to allow <br>
For example:<br></p>

<pre><code>const int dmv = 17; // dmv is a named constant
int var = 17; // var is not a constant
constexpr double max1 = 1.4*square(dmv); // OK if square(17) is a constant expression
constexpr double max2 = 1.4∗square(var); // error : var is not a constant expression
const double max3 = 1.4∗square(var); //OK, may be evaluated at run time
double sum(const vector&lt;double&gt;&amp;); // sum will not modify its argument (§2.2.5)
vector&lt;double&gt; v {1.2, 3.4, 4.5}; // v is not a constant
const double s1 = sum(v); // OK: evaluated at run time
constexpr double s2 = sum(v); // error : sum(v) not constant expression
</code></pre>

<p>For a function to be usable in a constant expression, that is, in an expression that will be evaluated
by the compiler, it must be defined <strong>constexpr</strong>.<br> For example:</p>

<pre><code>constexpr double square(double x) { return x∗x; }
</code></pre>

<p><br>
To be constexpr, a function must be rather simple: just a return-statement computing a value. A
constexpr function can be used for non-constant arguments, but when that is done the result is not a
constant expression. We allow a constexpr function to be called with non-constant-expression arguments
in contexts that do not require constant expressions, so that we don’t hav e to define essentially
the same function twice: once for constant expressions and once for variables.<br>
In a few places, constant expressions are required by language rules (e.g., array bounds (§2.2.5,
§7.3), case labels (§2.2.4, §9.4.2), some template arguments (§25.2), and constants declared using
constexpr). In other cases, compile-time evaluation is important for performance. Independently of
performance issues, the notion of immutability (of an object with an unchangeable state) is an
important design concern (§10.4).</p>

<p>You can see the results from Instruments here:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/cOjxq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice <code>_cg_jpeg_read_scanlines</code> and <code>decompress_onepass</code>.</p>

<p>I <em>was</em> force-decompressing the image with this:</p>

<pre><code>UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:path];
UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(CGSizeMake(1, 1));
[image drawAtPoint:CGPointZero];
UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
</code></pre>

<p>The timing of this was about 0.10 seconds, almost equivalent to the time taken by each <code>UIImageRepresentation</code> call.</p>

<p>There are numerous articles over the internet that recommend drawing as a way of force decompressing an image.</p>

<p>There's an article on Cocoanetics <a href=""http://www.cocoanetics.com/2011/10/avoiding-image-decompression-sickness/"" rel=""nofollow"">Avoiding Image Decompression Sickness</a>. The article provides an alternate way of loading the image:</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *dict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES]

UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:cgImage];

I'm running Rails 3.0.5 right now, and had updated briefly to 3.0.19 before reverting back. I believe that updated some gems and also made it so that the Rails gem was looking for the newest version greater than or equal to 0.8.7:</p>

<pre><code>rails (3.0.5)
  actionmailer (= 3.0.5)
  actionpack (= 3.0.5)
  activerecord (= 3.0.5)
  activeresource (= 3.0.5)
  activesupport (= 3.0.5)
  bundler (~&gt; 1.0)
  railties (= 3.0.5)
railties (3.0.5)
  actionpack (= 3.0.5)
  activesupport (= 3.0.5)
  rake (&gt;= 0.8.7)
  thor (~&gt; 0.14.4)
rake (0.8.7)

<p>I also uninstalled 10.0.3:</p>

<pre><code>gem uninstall rake --version 10.0.3

<p>After that, everything is back to running as it should. </p>

<p>If I didn't roll back rails 3.0.19, then I would have kept using rake 10.0.3.</p>

  <p>Is there a real-world scenario where a derived class uses a different allocator from its base, and relies on a virtual destructor to find the correct member <code>operator delete</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure what you would consider a real-world scenario, but the obvious example that comes to my mind is an inheritance hierarchy that's rooted in an abstract base class, with vastly different (in size) derived classes, a lot of which are created and destroyed regularly, while speed is required for those allocations/deallocations. </p>

<p>You might want custom allocators for those derived classes, because allocators for memory blobs of a specific size can be lightning fast, and you might want to use different allocators for each derived class, because their sizes are so different. </p>

<p>I can't give you a concrete example for this, though, because over the years I have found that <em>avoiding</em> allocation/deallocation pays off way better than speeding it up, so in almost twenty years I have rarely ever overloaded class-specific <code>new</code>/<code>delete</code>. (Of course, as usually when we're talking about sophisticated optimization, ""gaming"" comes up, so we could imagine a game that needs to create and destroy vast amounts of very different entities.)</p>

<p><strong>ARM</strong>
<a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka14267.html"">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.faqs/ka14267.html</a></p>

<p>This reference actually has sample code of a derived class overloading its base class overloaded new.</p>

<p><strong>Vanderbilt University</strong> <a href=""http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~adamsja/Courses/CS251/Projects/4/memPool.pdf"">http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~adamsja/Courses/CS251/Projects/4/memPool.pdf</a></p>

<p>This reference doesn't provide any material explicitly regarding overloading new in a derived class, however, it mentions some interesting reasons as why to overload new. Those reasons include:</p>

<ul>
<li>To compensate for suboptimal alignment in the default allocator</li>
<li>To cluster related objects near one another</li>
<li>To obtain unconventional behavior such as overwriting memory with zeros to increase the security of the application data</li>
</ul>

<p>Now based upon those two references, I've decided that there could be a few reasons for overloading new/delete in a derived class.  My reasons basically align with the reasons I listed from the VU presentation, but also seem relevant based upon the ARM reference implying to me an embedded or specialized scenario.</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded systems are often very custom at the hardware level, however, are common in a standardized sense at the software level.  I could see a situation where depending on a configuration setting/hardware strap, that at run-time a certain type of object (derived class) is chosen because it needs to allocate memory in a specific manner or specific location.</li>
<li>Clustering seems plausible because I could envision a scenario where some objects are treated the same in a high-level ""workflow"" but when processed, the different types of those objects are handled very differently.  It might be beneficial to locate specific types of objects near each other for process intensive tasks (ie. searching, sorting, prioritizing, etc).</li>
<li>The last point is interesting because I could see certain cases where the allocation depends on the security classification of the information being stored.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I haven't ever found a reason or actually implemented something like you have mentioned, but these are my thoughts with a little investigation.</p>

But the base would either need a virtual destructor, or the base object must never be the subject of <code>delete</code>.</p>

<p>Actually, the virtual destructor dispatch of <code>operator delete</code> is required independently of overloading. The feature probably exists to support multiple inheritance, and dynamically finding the correct member <code>operator delete</code> is just a side effect.</p>

<p>The rule is simply that a virtual destructor for a most-derived object calls <code>operator delete</code>. The main reason is to pass the correct most-derived pointer and size. That the context also enables the program to dynamically find the correct deallocation function is just a happy side effect.</p>

<p>So there may or may not be a useful application for dynamic <code>delete</code> dispatch, but there absolutely isn't a dedicated mechanism to make it work.</p>

<p>Specifically, envision e.g. an ARM chip with a small amount of TCM (tightly coupled memory; essentially, SRAM embedded on the SoC, with e.g. 1-cycle access time).</p>

<p>We then use profiler results very late in product development -- just before shipping (imagine that this is a cartridge for a popular handheld game system, for example) -- to determine that certain classes would benefit from being in this faster SRAM.</p>

<p>A simple member <code>operator new</code> that takes advantage of this TCM for just derived classes now may make sense: we can't afford to have the entire class hierarchy using this SRAM, but for certain low-instantiation-count but heavily-used derived classes, it becomes a simple and effective optimization.  We've gotten back 2%-10% or more of frame time in a few cases by redirecting certain allocations this way.</p>
